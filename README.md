## 4. Visualizations

### Visualization 1: Histogram of Typhoon Counts per Year
This histogram shows how the total number of typhoons changed each year from 2014 to 2024. It helps us visualize overall trends and the frequency of typhoon occurrences annually.

The distribution indicates that most years experience a moderate number of typhoons, with occasional peaks showing particularly active years.

### Visualization 2: KDE Plot of Monthly Typhoon Frequency
This Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot highlights the distribution of monthly typhoon occurrences. It helps identify months with the highest likelihood of typhoon activity.

The density curve shows that typhoon frequency increases during mid to late months of the year, aligning with the wet season (around July to October).

### Visualization 3: Scatter Plot — Month vs. Typhoon Count
This scatter plot displays the relationship between months and the number of typhoons recorded. It allows us to visually identify seasonal patterns and variability across months.

The plot clearly shows clustering around the mid-year months, suggesting that most typhoons occur between June and November.

### Visualization 4: Pairplot — Number of Typhoons, Month, and Year
This pairplot explores the relationships among the year, month, and number of typhoons. It provides a multi-variable view that can reveal underlying trends or correlations.
