## 4. Visualizations

### Visualization 1: Histogram of Typhoon Counts per Year
This histogram shows how the total number of typhoons changed each year from 2014 to 2024. It helps us visualize overall trends and the frequency of typhoon occurrences annually.

The distribution indicates that most years experience a moderate number of typhoons, with occasional peaks showing particularly active years.

### Visualization 2: KDE Plot of Monthly Typhoon Frequency
This Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot highlights the distribution of monthly typhoon occurrences. It helps identify months with the highest likelihood of typhoon activity.

The density curve shows that typhoon frequency increases during mid to late months of the year, aligning with the wet season (around July to October).

### Visualization 3: Scatter Plot — Month vs. Typhoon Count
This scatter plot displays the relationship between months and the number of typhoons recorded. It allows us to visually identify seasonal patterns and variability across months.

The plot clearly shows clustering around the mid-year months, suggesting that most typhoons occur between June and November.

### Visualization 4: Pairplot — Number of Typhoons, Month, and Year
This pairplot explores the relationships among the year, month, and number of typhoons. It provides a multi-variable view that can reveal underlying trends or correlations.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a49933b9-6b1d-471a-9a8a-72b1bad2bf31" width="800">

The scatter relationships indicate that typhoon counts vary seasonally but remain relatively consistent across the decade.

### Visualization 5: Correlation Matrix of Numeric Variables
This heatmap displays correlations among numeric variables such as year, month, and number of typhoons. It helps determine which variables are most related to one another.

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b83e5625-9eb3-4680-a886-e46678c4428d" width="800">

The correlation values show that month and typhoon count are somewhat related due to seasonality, while year has a weaker correlation, suggesting no clear long-term increase or decrease.

### Visualization 6: Missingness Plot
This plot helps us identify if there are missing or incomplete data points in the dataset. By visualizing the presence of null values, we can determine whether the dataset is complete or needs cleaning before analysis.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/289f6fed-1471-4aab-bbd4-4ad32564c265" width="800">

Based on the plot, there appear to be no missing or incomplete values — indicating that the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.

### Visualization 7: Typhoon Counts per Season (Wet vs Dry)
This bar plot compares the total number of typhoons that occurred during the wet and dry seasons. It allows us to see which season experiences more typhoon activity in the Philippines.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4790561b-1a83-46da-b348-acc657caf829" width="800">

The wet season shows a significantly higher number of typhoons compared to the dry season, which aligns with the country’s typical climate pattern from June to November.
